# Workout Tracker — Implementation Summary

This document summarizes what has been built so far, the interactive behavior, design details, and decisions made while iterating on the mockups.

## Overview
- Two interactive mockup pages matching the specification with a mobile-first layout (430px container), dark theme, and color-coded training feedback.
- Focused on the three exercises with special handling for RDL and incline bench dumbbells.
- Implements key in-session interactions: rep/RIR input, segmented bars, stacked RIR cap, rest timer, weight adjustment chips, undo, and localStorage persistence.

## Files
- `workoutclaude/home_screen_mockup.html` — Home screen with exercise cards, clickable to start a session, and mini history previews.
- `workoutclaude/exercise_detail_mockup.html` — Interactive workout page with timers, weight input, rep/RIR selection, and segmented set bars.
- `WORKOUT_TRACKER_SPECIFICATION.md` — Provided specification document (source of requirements).
- `WORKOUT_TRACKER_IMPLEMENTATION.md` — This document.

## Home Screen
Location: `workoutclaude/home_screen_mockup.html`

Implemented
- Exercise cards for Lat Pulldown, Incline Bench (dumbbells), and Dumbbell RDL.
- Clickable navigation: each card links to the exercise page via `exercise_detail_mockup.html?exercise=<id>`.
- Start button opens the Lat Pulldown session by default.
- “Last 6 sessions” mini history grids:
  - Oldest on the left, newest on the right (true chronological order).
  - Each session shows 3–4 small bars (one per set) with a top “RIR cap” color.
  - Per-session weight label rendered beneath each day’s bars.
- Color legend moved to the top, above the exercise cards (not duplicated within cards):
  - Rep zones: 1–5 yellow, 6–8 green, 9–10 blue
  - RIR colors: 1 orange, 2 green, 3 blue (0 red is not shown in legend but supported)
- RDL specifics:
  - History sessions display 3 bars per day (RDL is 3 sets).
  - All RDL weights on the home screen are total weights (e.g., “140 lb”), not per-hand.
  - Recommendation text clarified to “+5 lb recommended”.

Notes
- Home history is currently static demonstration data. It is not yet wired to live session logs. (See “Next Steps”.)

## Exercise Detail
Location: `workoutclaude/exercise_detail_mockup.html`

Exercises
- Lat Pulldown: 4 sets; weight unit `lb`; base rest 2:30 (auto-extend to 3:00 if RIR ≤ 1).
- Incline Bench Press (~30°): 4 sets; now treated as dumbbells with per-hand weight.
  - Default per-hand: `77.5 lb/hand` (reflects half of previous 155 total).
  - Unit displayed and stored as `lb/hand`.
- Dumbbell RDL: 3 sets; weight unit `lb/hand` in spec, but the home page shows totals. The session page currently stores single value per exercise per its config.

Key Interactions
- Rep and RIR selection:
  - Rep buttons 1–10 color-coded by zone: 1–5 yellow, 6–8 green, 9–10 blue.
  - RIR buttons 0–3 with labels (0 Failure, 1 Hard, 2 Good, 3 Easy).
  - Pending selection previews live on the current set’s bar.
- Segmented set bars:
  - 4 or 3 vertical bars (one per set), each with 10 segments.
  - Bars fill from bottom up, using zone colors: 1–5 yellow, 6–8 green, 9–10 blue.
  - RIR cap sits directly above the highest filled rep segment (stacked on top, not at the top of the frame).
  - RIR cap has a striped overlay in the same color family to distinguish it from reps.
- Weight input & chips:
  - Freeform input supporting keyboard entry.
  - Quick chips: ±2.5 and ±5.
  - Layout refined so the weight “pill” doesn’t extend behind the chips (shorter max-width and increased grid gap).
- Rest timer:
  - Shows MM:SS; -30s and +30s controls adjust remaining time.
  - Auto-starts when a set is logged.
  - Auto-extends for hard sets (RIR ≤ 1) using the exercise’s extended rest.
  - Resumes countdown on reload if still running.
- Set flow & undo:
  - “Log Set & Start Rest Timer” saves the current set’s reps + RIR and advances to the next set.
  - “Undo” clears the last logged set and resets the timer to base.
  - When all sets are logged, the primary button is disabled with a completion message.

Form Cues
- Lightweight rotation of exercise-specific form cues in the header banner.

## State & Persistence
- Per-exercise localStorage key: `workoutclaude:session:<exerciseId>`.
- Stored shape:
  ```json
  {
    "currentSet": number,
    "sets": [{"reps": number, "rir": number|null}, ...],
    "weight": number,
    "timerRemaining": number,
    "timerRunning": boolean
  }
  ```
- Guards against spec changes: if the stored number of sets differs from current config, a fresh state is used.

## Design System
- Dark gradient background: `#1e1e2e → #2a2d3a`.
- Cards: `#1a1d29` to `#202332`, border `#3a3d4a`, subtle drop shadows.
- Colors:
  - Primary Blue `#64b5f6`, Success Green `#4caf50`, Warning Yellow `#ffc107`, Caution Orange `#ff9800`, Alert Red `#f44336`.
- Typography: system UI stack; headers ~28px on home, ~24px on exercise; body 14–16px.
- Components: rounded corners (16px cards; 8–12px buttons), large touch targets, light CSS transitions.

## Iteration Log (User-Requested Changes)
1) Initial mockups created per spec: home + exercise screens; visuals only.
2) Wired interactivity: timers, rep/RIR select, set logging, undo, weight chips, localStorage, and navigation via query param.
3) Fixed rep zone mapping to ensure bottom-up: 1–5 yellow, 6–8 green, 9–10 blue.
4) RIR cap stacked directly above the highest filled rep instead of at the top.
5) Home: reordered history to oldest → newest; added per-session weight labels; moved color legend to the top; removed screenshot; left RIR caps unchanged on home.
6) Home: RDL uses total weights in labels and card; recommendation text clarified; RDL shows 3 sets in history.
7) Exercise page: RIR cap gained a striped overlay for clarity; incline bench switched to per-hand `lb/hand` default at `77.5`.
8) Exercise page UI polish: prevented weight input pill from extending under chips; later shortened pill further and increased spacing.

## Known Limitations / Not Yet Implemented
- Home history is static: does not yet reflect actual logged sessions.
- Intelligent progression is not yet computed or surfaced on the home screen from session data.
- No global settings, unit conversions, or validation beyond basic formatting.
- No export/import of data or multi-day scheduling.

## How to Run / View
- Open `workoutclaude/home_screen_mockup.html` in a browser (drag-and-drop or `open` on macOS).
- Click an exercise card to open the interactive session view (`exercise_detail_mockup.html?exercise=<id>`).

## Suggested Next Steps
- Wire home history to localStorage session summaries (most recent 6 per exercise) with accurate set counts and weights.
- Add a lightweight progression engine on session completion (e.g., check ≥9 reps across sets at RIR 1–2 → compute suggested increment).
- Persist last used weights and display them on the home cards; show delta arrows on increases.
- Add clear and reset controls for sessions/history.
- Optional: per-exercise rest-range controls and audible/visual rest completion cues.

If you want, I can implement the “history from real logged sessions” next so the home screen reflects actual training data automatically.
